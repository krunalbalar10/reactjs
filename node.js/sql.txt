agreegate function 
    function which returns only single value is called agreegate function in sql. it works only on numeric fields.

    sum()
        return sum of given field

        select sum(amount) from payments

    avg()
        findout average of payments 
        select avg(amount) from payments

    max()
        findout maximum value of given field. 
        select max(amount) from payments

we can use agreegate function with where clause 

findout total payment made by customerNumber 113
select sum(amount),customerNumber from payments where customerNumber=113
select IFNULL(sum(amount),0) as sum,customerNumber from payments where customerNumber=113
